# To create a property of a class, you use the @property decorator. Underhood, the @property decorator uses the property class that has three methods: setter, getter, and deleter.
#
# By using the deleter, you can delete a property from an object. Notice that the deleter() method deletes a property of an object, not a class.
#
# The following defines the Person class with the name property:

from pprint import pprint


class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        if value.strip() == '':
            raise ValueError('name cannot be empty')
        self._name = value

    @name.deleter
    def name(self):
        del self._name

# In the Person class, we use the @name.deleter decorator. Inside the deleter, we use the del keyword to delete the _name attribute of the Person instance.

# The following shows the __dict__ of the Person class:

pprint(Person.__dict__)

# Output:

# mappingproxy({'__dict__': <attribute '__dict__' of 'Person' objects>,
#               '__doc__': None,
#               '__init__': <function Person.__init__ at 0x000001DC41D62670>,
#               '__module__': '__main__',
#               '__weakref__': <attribute '__weakref__' of 'Person' objects>,
#               'name': <property object at 0x000001DC41C89130>})

# The Person.__dict__ class has the name variable. The following creates a new instance of the Person class:

person = Person('John')

# The person.__dict__ has the _name attribute:

pprint(person.__dict__)

# Output:

# {'_name': 'John'}

# The following uses the del keyword to delete the name property:

del person.name

# Internally, Python will execute the deleter method that deletes the _name attribute from the person object. The person.__dict__ will be empty like this:

{}

# And if you attempt to access name property again, youâ€™ll get an error:

print(person.name)

# Error:
#
# AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute '_name'
#
# Summary
# Use the deleter decorator to delete a property of an instance of a class.
